Execute backlog task `$ARGUMENTS` end-to-end. The flow runs entirely as Claude Code subagents — no orchestrator subprocess, no shadow auth/state. One task per invocation; compose with `/loop /ai-sdlc execute <task-id>` for batches.

## Step 0 — Sweep merged worktrees (auto-cleanup)

Before doing anything else, scan `.worktrees/` and remove any whose branch's PR has merged into `main`. This is the eventual-cleanup mechanism — running `/ai-sdlc execute` regularly keeps the worktree directory tidy without any manual intervention.

```bash
if [ -d .worktrees ]; then
  for wt in .worktrees/*/; do
    [ -d "$wt" ] || continue
    WT_BRANCH=$(git -C "$wt" rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null)
    [ -z "$WT_BRANCH" ] && continue
    [ "$WT_BRANCH" = "HEAD" ] && continue   # detached, skip
    # Check if a PR for this branch exists and is merged
    MERGED_AT=$(gh pr list --head "$WT_BRANCH" --state merged --json mergedAt --jq '.[0].mergedAt' 2>/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$MERGED_AT" ] && [ "$MERGED_AT" != "null" ]; then
      echo "Sweeping merged worktree: $wt (branch $WT_BRANCH merged at $MERGED_AT)"
      git worktree remove --force "$wt" 2>/dev/null || true
    fi
  done
fi
```

This runs SILENTLY when nothing matches. If anything was swept, print one line per removal so the operator can see what happened.

For ad-hoc / manual cleanup of a specific task without waiting for the next `/ai-sdlc execute`, use the `/ai-sdlc cleanup [<task-id>]` companion command.

## Step 1 — Validate the task

Find the task file and read its frontmatter:

```bash
TASK_ID="$ARGUMENTS"   # e.g. AISDLC-68
TASK_ID_LOWER="$(echo "$TASK_ID" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')"
TASK_FILE=$(ls "backlog/tasks/${TASK_ID_LOWER} -"* 2>/dev/null | head -1)
[ -z "$TASK_FILE" ] && { echo "ERROR: no task file for $TASK_ID"; exit 1; }
```

Read the task with `mcp__backlog__task_view` to render its full structure. Then verify:

- **Status** is `To Do` or `In Progress` (not `Draft`, not `Done`). If `Done`, refuse — already shipped. If `Draft`, refuse — not ready.
- **At least one acceptance criterion** exists. If none, refuse — task isn't actionable.
- **Not all ACs already checked** while status is `In Progress` — that's a stale-Done shape; refuse and ask the user to triage.

If validation fails, print the reason clearly and stop. Don't create a worktree.

## Step 2 — Compute branch name

The branch pattern lives in `.ai-sdlc/pipeline-backlog.yaml` under `branching.pattern`. Today it's `ai-sdlc/{issueIdLower}-{slug}` where `{slug}` is a kebab-cased version of the task title.

```bash
BRANCH_PATTERN=$(grep -A2 'branching:' .ai-sdlc/pipeline-backlog.yaml | grep 'pattern:' | sed -E "s/.*pattern: *'([^']+)'.*/\1/")
TITLE=$(grep -E '^title:' "$TASK_FILE" | sed -E 's/title: *"?([^"]+)"?/\1/')
SLUG=$(echo "$TITLE" | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | sed -E 's/[^a-z0-9]+/-/g; s/^-+|-+$//g' | cut -c1-50)
BRANCH=$(echo "$BRANCH_PATTERN" | sed "s|{issueIdLower}|$TASK_ID_LOWER|g; s|{slug}|$SLUG|g")
WORKTREE_PATH=".worktrees/$TASK_ID_LOWER"
```

## Step 3 — Set up the worktree

```bash
git fetch origin main
mkdir -p .worktrees
git worktree add "$WORKTREE_PATH" -b "$BRANCH" origin/main
```

If `git worktree add` fails because the branch already exists, the operator's prior run left state. Tell them: "Worktree branch `$BRANCH` already exists. Run `/ai-sdlc cleanup $TASK_ID` first, or pick a different task." Then stop.

## Step 4 — Flip task to In Progress + write active-task sentinel

Use `mcp__backlog__task_edit` to set `status: 'In Progress'`. This makes the dashboard reflect that work has started.

Then write the active-task sentinel file so the PreToolUse hook can resolve `permittedExternalPaths` for cross-repo writes:

```bash
mkdir -p .worktrees
echo "$TASK_ID" > .worktrees/.active-task
```

The sentinel is the canonical source of truth for "which task is currently active in this session." The hook reads it on every Write/Edit; without it, cross-repo writes are denied. CRITICAL: this file MUST be deleted at end of run (Step 13) regardless of success/failure, otherwise the next `/ai-sdlc execute` invocation inherits the stale active task. Treat it as a try/finally — if anything fails between here and Step 13, still delete.

> **Single-task limitation**: only one `/ai-sdlc execute` may run at a time. Parallel runs would race on the sentinel. v2 may add per-worktree sentinels.

## Step 5 — Invoke the developer subagent

Spawn the `developer` agent against the worktree. Build the prompt from the task content:

```
You are implementing backlog task $TASK_ID in worktree $WORKTREE_PATH.

## Task title
<title from frontmatter>

## Description
<body of the task file, between the AC list and the next ## section>

## Acceptance criteria
<numbered list from the task>

## References
<refs from frontmatter — read as needed via Read tool>

## Permitted external paths (cross-repo writes)
<permittedExternalPaths from frontmatter, or "none">

## Verification commands (run before commit)
- pnpm build
- pnpm test
- pnpm lint
- pnpm format:check

## Commit message template
<conventional-commit type>: <subject> ($TASK_ID)

<body>

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>

## Branch
You are on branch `$BRANCH` checked out at `$WORKTREE_PATH`.

Return the JSON shape documented in your agent definition.
```

When invoking the Task tool for the developer agent:

- `subagent_type: developer`
- The agent's cwd will be the worktree path
- The PreToolUse hook will read the active task ID from `.worktrees/.active-task` (written in Step 4) to resolve `permittedExternalPaths` for cross-repo writes

Watch for `[ai-sdlc-progress]` lines in the agent's tool output and surface them to the user as they appear.

## Step 6 — Parse developer return value

The developer returns a JSON object. Parse it and check:

- If `commitSha` is `null`, the developer couldn't complete the task. Print the `notes` field, revert the task to `To Do` via `mcp__backlog__task_edit`, leave the worktree on disk for inspection, and stop. Print: "Worktree preserved at `$WORKTREE_PATH`. To clean up: `/ai-sdlc cleanup $TASK_ID`."
- If any of `verifications.{build,test,lint}` is `failed`, treat as developer failure (same rollback as above).
- Otherwise proceed to review.

## Step 7 — Run three reviews in parallel

Build the review context once, share across all reviewers:

```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git diff origin/main...HEAD > "/tmp/pr-diff-${TASK_ID}.txt"
git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD > "/tmp/pr-files-${TASK_ID}.txt"
cd -
```

Detect Codex availability once (the reviewer agents declare `harness: codex`):

```bash
if which codex >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  HARNESS_NOTE=""
else
  HARNESS_NOTE="⚠ INDEPENDENCE NOT ENFORCED (codex unavailable, fell back to claude-code)"
fi
```

Spawn **three subagents in parallel** (single message, three Task tool calls):

- `subagent_type: code-reviewer`
- `subagent_type: test-reviewer`
- `subagent_type: security-reviewer`

Each prompt should contain:

- The PR diff (from `/tmp/pr-diff-${TASK_ID}.txt`)
- The task title, description, AC list
- Contents of `.ai-sdlc/review-policy.md` if present (project-specific calibration)
- The branch name + base (`main`)

Each returns a verdict JSON: `{ approved, findings, summary }`.

## Step 8 — Aggregate verdicts

Combine the three verdicts:

- Count findings by severity across all reviewers (`critical`, `major`, `minor`, `suggestion`).
- If `HARNESS_NOTE` is non-empty, prepend it to the aggregated summary so the operator sees the independence warning every time it applies.
- Compute the gate decision:
  - **APPROVED**: all three reviewers approved AND no `critical`/`major` findings → proceed to PR (Step 10).
  - **CHANGES REQUESTED**: any `critical` or `major` findings → enter the iteration loop (Step 9).

Print the aggregation summary to the user before proceeding.

## Step 9 — Iteration loop (max 2 dev iterations on review failure)

Track iteration count starting at 1 (the first developer pass already ran).

While `iteration_count < 2` AND there are still critical/major findings:

1. Increment `iteration_count`.
2. Re-spawn the `developer` subagent with the SAME task context PLUS a `## Reviewer feedback (round N)` section listing the findings as bullet items (file:line — message). Tell the developer to address them and re-run verification.
3. Re-run the three parallel reviews against the updated diff.
4. Re-aggregate; if approved, break out of the loop and proceed to PR (Step 10).

After the loop, if there are STILL critical/major findings, do NOT abort. Open the PR anyway with the `[needs-human-attention]` flag in the body so the human can take it from there. The work is preserved, the human decides next steps.

```
PR title: feat: <task title> [needs-human-attention] (<task-id>)
PR body opens with: > **⚠ This PR exceeded the auto-iteration cap (2 rounds) with unresolved review findings. Human review/intervention requested.**
```

Then collapse all three review verdicts (round-by-round if multiple iterations ran) into `<details>` blocks in the PR body.

## Step 10 — Mark task Done + commit the file move (BEFORE push)

This step lands the entire task lifecycle inside a single PR — Done state, file move, and the implementation work all merge atomically. Per CLAUDE.md (this command's authority): for tasks shipped via `/ai-sdlc execute`, **Done = "reviews-approved-and-PR-opened"**, not "merged."

Skip this step entirely if the iteration cap was exceeded (the PR is `[needs-human-attention]` — let the human flip Done after they're satisfied via `/ai-sdlc complete <task-id>` or by hand).

If reviews approved cleanly:

1. **Build `acceptanceCriteriaCheck`** — list all AC indices `[1..N]` by default. If reviewers explicitly contested any AC ("AC #3 not actually met" wording), drop those indices.
2. **Build `finalSummary`** — assemble per the CLAUDE.md template:
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   <developer's `summary` field>

   ## Changes
   <bullet list of files from developer's `filesChanged` with one-liner each>

   ## Design decisions
   <from developer's `notes` field, or "(none)" if empty>

   ## Verification
   - `pnpm build` — <developer.verifications.build>
   - `pnpm test` — <developer.verifications.test>
   - `pnpm lint` — <developer.verifications.lint>
   - `pnpm format:check` — <developer.verifications.format>
   - 3 parallel reviews approved (<HARNESS_NOTE if any>)

   ## Follow-up
   (none) | <anything from developer.notes>
   ```
3. **Call `mcp__backlog__task_edit`** with `id: $TASK_ID`, `status: 'Done'`, `acceptanceCriteriaCheck: [...]`, `finalSummary: '...'`.
4. **Call `mcp__backlog__task_complete`** with `id: $TASK_ID` — this physically moves `backlog/tasks/<file>.md` → `backlog/completed/<file>.md`.
5. **Stage and commit the move** in the worktree as a separate commit so the developer's commit stays clean:
   ```bash
   cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
   git add backlog/tasks backlog/completed
   git commit -m "chore: mark $TASK_ID complete

   Auto-generated by /ai-sdlc execute. Reviews approved; task lifecycle landed in this PR.

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   cd -
   ```

When the PR merges, the file is already in `backlog/completed/` on `main` — no race with the post-merge workflow.

## Step 11 — Push and open PR

```bash
cd "$WORKTREE_PATH"
git push -u origin "$BRANCH"
```

If push fails with non-fast-forward (someone else pushed to the same branch), abort with a clear message — the cleanup story is "delete the remote branch and rerun" but that's a destructive action so we ask the user first.

Compose the PR title from `.ai-sdlc/pipeline-backlog.yaml` `pullRequest.titleTemplate` (today: `feat: {issueTitle} ({issueId})`).

Compose the PR body from:
- The developer's `summary` field
- A list of changed files (`git diff --name-only origin/main...HEAD`)
- A `<details>` block with the code-reviewer verdict
- A footer: `References $TASK_ID` (NOT `Closes` — backlog tasks aren't auto-closed by GitHub PR merges; the `.github/workflows/backlog-task-complete.yml` workflow handles it)

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "<composed title>" \
  --body "<composed body>" \
  --base main \
  --head "$BRANCH"
```

Print the PR URL. Capture it as `MAIN_PR_URL`.

## Step 12 — Cross-repo PRs (siblings under permittedExternalPaths)

If the developer reported `filesChangedExternal` (sibling-repo writes) AND the task's frontmatter has `permittedExternalPaths`, create one parallel PR per dirty sibling repo:

For each entry in `developer.filesChangedExternal`:

1. **Verify it's a git repo**:
   ```bash
   SIBLING="<dev-reported repo path>"
   git -C "$SIBLING" rev-parse --show-toplevel >/dev/null 2>&1 || continue
   ```
2. **Check the dirty state matches what the developer claimed** (`git -C $SIBLING status --porcelain`). If empty, skip — nothing to push.
3. **Confirm `gh` auth works for the sibling**:
   ```bash
   gh -R "$(gh -C $SIBLING repo view --json nameWithOwner -q .nameWithOwner 2>/dev/null)" auth status >/dev/null 2>&1
   ```
   If it fails, skip with a clear warning: "⚠ Cannot create sibling PR for `$SIBLING` — gh auth not configured for that repo. Files left dirty for manual handling: <list>."
4. **Create a parallel branch** in the sibling using the same task slug:
   ```bash
   SIBLING_BRANCH="ai-sdlc/${TASK_ID_LOWER}-sibling"
   git -C "$SIBLING" checkout -b "$SIBLING_BRANCH"
   git -C "$SIBLING" add -- <files reported by developer>
   git -C "$SIBLING" commit -m "feat: <task title> — sibling for $TASK_ID

   Companion changes for $MAIN_PR_URL.

   Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>"
   git -C "$SIBLING" push -u origin "$SIBLING_BRANCH"
   ```
5. **Open the sibling PR** with a body that links back to the main PR:
   ```bash
   gh -R "<sibling repo>" pr create \
     --title "feat: <task title> — sibling for $TASK_ID" \
     --body "Companion PR for $MAIN_PR_URL ($TASK_ID).

   <developer's summary>

   Files changed: <list>" \
     --base main \
     --head "$SIBLING_BRANCH"
   ```
6. **Capture the sibling PR URL.**

If any sibling PR creation fails partway, do NOT roll back the main PR — print the failure clearly and tell the operator to handle the sibling manually. Each sibling is independent.

After all siblings:
- Update the main PR body via `gh pr edit $MAIN_PR_URL --body "..."` to add a `## Sibling PRs` section listing each sibling URL.

## Step 13 — Cleanup sentinel + Report

Always remove the active-task sentinel — the hook would otherwise see a stale active task on the next invocation:

```bash
rm -f .worktrees/.active-task
```

Run this whether the run succeeded, failed, was rolled back, or escalated. It's the closing bracket of the implicit try/finally started at Step 4.

Then print a tight summary:

- ✅ Task: `$TASK_ID` — `<title>`
- ✅ Branch: `$BRANCH` (worktree at `$WORKTREE_PATH`)
- ✅ Developer: `<N>` files, commit `<sha>`
- ✅ Reviews: `<APPROVED | NEEDS HUMAN ATTENTION>` — `<N>` critical, `<N>` major, `<N>` minor across 3 reviewers (`<HARNESS_NOTE if any>`)
- ✅ Iterations: `<N>` (capped at 2)
- ✅ PR: `<url>`
- ✅ Sibling PRs (if any): `<url>` for each
- ℹ️  Worktree retained for inspection. Will be auto-removed on next `/ai-sdlc execute` once this PR merges.

## What this command DOES NOT do (intentional)

- **Never runs `gh pr merge`.** Per CLAUDE.md, only humans merge.
- **Never runs `git push --force`.** If push fails, asks the operator.
- **Never edits `.ai-sdlc/**` or `.github/workflows/**`.** PreToolUse hook blocks anyway, but the developer prompt makes this explicit.
- **Does not yet** sweep merged worktrees on start (Step 7 of the larger plan). That lands in the next commit.
