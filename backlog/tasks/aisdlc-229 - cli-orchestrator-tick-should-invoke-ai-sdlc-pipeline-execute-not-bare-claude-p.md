## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
## Problem

`cli-orchestrator tick` currently shells out to `claude --print --agent developer …` via `ShellClaudePSpawner` for each admitted task. That subprocess runs Steps 0-5 of the pipeline (worktree alloc, sentinel, dev subagent dispatch) and then RETURNS — it never runs Steps 6-13:

- Step 7: spawn 3 reviewer subagents (code/test/security)
- Step 8: aggregate verdicts → write `.ai-sdlc/verdicts/<task-id-lower>.json`
- Step 10: sign DSSE attestation envelope
- Step 11: push branch + open PR
- Step 12: open sibling-repo PRs (if `permittedExternalPaths` declared)
- Step 13: cleanup `.active-task` sentinel

Result: every orchestrator-driven dispatch leaves a half-finished worktree (dev commit, no reviewers, no attestation, no PR) and depends on the operator's main Claude Code session to manually compose the rest. That defeats the entire point of "autonomous orchestration."

This is the load-bearing missing wiring between **AISDLC-182** (`ai-sdlc-pipeline execute` umbrella, DONE — runs Steps 0-13 in one binary) and **AISDLC-225** (`claude-cli` spawner manifest-consumer bridge, filed). Once both ship, `cli-orchestrator tick` should call AISDLC-182's umbrella with `--spawner claude-cli` per dispatch and get the full pipeline for free.

## Witnessed empirically 2026-05-07

Operator dispatched AISDLC-178.4.1 + AISDLC-178.5 via `cli-orchestrator tick`. Both tick runs:

1. Filtered the frontier ✓
2. Allocated worktree ✓
3. Wrote `.active-task` sentinel ✓
4. Shelled `claude --print --agent developer …` to dev ✓
5. Dev returned a commit ✓
6. **STOPPED** — orchestrator's `tick` returned `dispatched: [AISDLC-178.5]`, considered itself done

The operator (via the main Claude Code session) had to:
- Spawn 3 reviewer subagents via `Agent({subagent_type: …})`
- Build verdict JSON, write to `/tmp/`
- `node ai-sdlc-plugin/scripts/sign-attestation.mjs --review-verdicts …`
- `git push` + `gh pr create`

…for every single dispatched task. With 5+ tasks per session, that's 5x the work the orchestrator was supposed to obviate.

## Proposed fix

### Architecture

`cli-orchestrator tick`'s dispatch step should invoke AISDLC-182's umbrella:

```typescript
// Today (pipeline-cli/src/orchestrator/spawner/shell-claude-p.ts approx)
spawn('claude', ['--print', '--agent', 'developer', '--permission-mode', 'bypassPermissions', prompt]);

// Proposed (uses AISDLC-182's umbrella)
spawn('node', [
  'pipeline-cli/bin/ai-sdlc-pipeline.mjs',
  'execute', taskId,
  '--spawner', 'claude-cli',  // requires AISDLC-225's consumer bridge to fan reviewers out
  '--run',
  '--max-iterations', '2',
]);
```

The umbrella handles ALL Steps 0-13. Orchestrator just waits on the subprocess + parses its return code.

### Hard dependency on AISDLC-225

`--spawner claude-cli` emits a manifest describing the subagents to spawn (developer + 3 reviewers) but currently has no consumer bridge to actually invoke `Agent`. Until AISDLC-225 ships, calling `ai-sdlc-pipeline execute --spawner claude-cli --run` from `cli-orchestrator tick` would still skip reviewers — same as today.

So this task BLOCKS on AISDLC-225 (declared as `dependencies: [AISDLC-225]` above).

### Spawner fallback while AISDLC-225 is in flight

To avoid sitting idle waiting for AISDLC-225, this task can ship a **fallback path**: if `--spawner claude-cli` consumer bridge isn't healthy, log a warning and fall through to `--spawner api-key` (paid Anthropic API). This lets unattended orchestrator runs work end-to-end TODAY at the cost of API-key billing for those runs. Operator opt-in via `AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_SPAWNER_FALLBACK=api-key`.

### Why a new task vs. amending AISDLC-225 / extending AISDLC-182

- **AISDLC-182** is shipped and explicitly out of scope for orchestrator integration (its README comparison table shows orchestrator as a separate path).
- **AISDLC-225** is the manifest-consumer bridge — its scope is "make `claude-cli` spawner actually fan out subagents," not "wire orchestrator to call the umbrella."
- This task is the wiring step that connects 182's umbrella to the orchestrator's tick loop. Discrete change, discrete review, discrete cost-of-ownership for unattended ops.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] #1 `cli-orchestrator tick` replaces `ShellClaudePSpawner` invocation with `node pipeline-cli/bin/ai-sdlc-pipeline.mjs execute <task-id> --spawner claude-cli --run --max-iterations 2`
- [ ] #2 If the `claude-cli` spawner reports the AISDLC-225 consumer bridge is missing, fall back to `--spawner api-key` IF `AI_SDLC_ORCHESTRATOR_SPAWNER_FALLBACK=api-key` is set; otherwise abort the dispatch with a clear error
- [ ] #3 Tick output schema unchanged: `dispatched: [taskId]`, `outcomes`, `escalations`, `idleEvent` — orchestrator's existing log + Slack consumers don't break
- [ ] #4 `outcomes[i]` now includes `pipeline.attestationSha` (head SHA after attestation chore commit), `pipeline.prNumber`, `pipeline.reviewerVerdicts: { code: "approved"|"changes-requested", test: ..., security: ... }`, `pipeline.iterations`
- [ ] #5 If the umbrella returns non-zero (dev failed, reviewer iteration cap exhausted, push-and-pr conflicted), tick records `outcomes[i].failure: { type, message }` and continues to the next admitted task — NEVER blocks the entire tick
- [ ] #6 Hermetic test: stub `ai-sdlc-pipeline execute` binary to return success/failure JSON; verify orchestrator's tick output is correctly populated for both paths
- [ ] #7 Integration test (real binary, mock spawner): runs end-to-end against a fixture task; verifies (a) tick admits the task, (b) umbrella runs to completion, (c) tick output reflects the umbrella's exit envelope
- [ ] #8 Operator runbook updated at `docs/operations/orchestrator-runbook.md` with: (a) the new spawner-fallback env, (b) the `pipeline.*` outcome fields, (c) "what to do if the umbrella fails mid-tick"
- [ ] #9 Composes cleanly with AISDLC-228 (Step 3 quarantine guard): if a task's tick fails with the umbrella, `quarantine/<task>-<ts>` ref captures the half-finished work for forensic inspection
- [ ] #10 Documentation: `pipeline-cli/docs/orchestrator.md` adds a section "How tick connects to AISDLC-182's umbrella" with the spawner decision tree

## Composes with / blocks on

- **Blocks on AISDLC-225** — manifest-consumer bridge for `claude-cli` spawner. Without this, `--spawner claude-cli` still skips reviewers.
- **Composes with AISDLC-227** — once orchestrator runs the umbrella, the in-flight detection filter (227) gates duplicate dispatch BEFORE the umbrella starts; otherwise we'd get duplicated half-finished worktrees.
- **Composes with AISDLC-228** — Step 3 quarantine guard (228) protects the umbrella's mid-flight worktree from being clobbered by a parallel tick.
- **Composes with AISDLC-226** — stale-dist auto-rebuild (226) ensures the umbrella binary is current before tick invokes it.

The four together (225, 226, 227, 228, 229) are the Phase 6 of RFC-0015 hardening that makes unattended orchestrator operation actually work end-to-end. Should ship as a coordinated batch — none stands alone in production.
